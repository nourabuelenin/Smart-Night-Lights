Smart Light Using PIR and LDR


Night Activated PIR Motion Sensor initiates its operation whenever the circuit experiences any movement in its range. This circuit will also consequently be enacted around evening time and go off at day due to the light detection feature that will be added.

Night Activated PIR Motion Sensor circuit design is centered around a passive infrared (PIR) motion detector module, type HC-SR501. The PIR sensor used detects the radiated heat of a person and these data converts to an electrical signal, this signal is sent to the switching for processing, then the signal creates a specific voltage for the relay to activate the power switching. When nobody is detected, the power is automatically turned off.

The PIR motion detector module is used here with an added ambient light detection (day/night) feature using LDR. The task of LDR is to detect the approaching of human person based on the principle of light/dark sensing.

The main objective of this project is to implement a system for power saving. When the roomâ€™s light is switched off or goes off due to power cut, the LED in circuit glows automatically. For the power control system, a detection method is used for a power ON/OFF automatically in respective place.
